		<p>This can be used for calculating payments for a credit card or even for something like a mortage. Note: it doesn't work for Internet Explorer (at least when I tried it). I apologize for this. I will try to fix it eventually.</p>

		<p>To calculate the minimal payment to pay in X amount of months, leave the payment option empty. To calculate the min. months it will take, leave months empty while filling in pament. Fill in both of them to calculate the payment info for that period of time.</p>

		<p>Local storage to stop input data and the table info, so this may not work for older browsers. Also, it uses worker to calculate the data, but I will eventually (hopefully) have a fallback to have browser do it if it doesn't work. Also, there's canvas that makes the pie chart but isn't significant.</p>
