A site to calculate the interest from loans (I used credit cards as a starting basis, but I don't have much experience with interest so results may vary). Can also work for loans.


Used on Mozilla Firefox.
Chrome doesn't work with workers locally (offline). Possibly local storage, too?


Future (possible?) implementations:
* 'selecting' will highlight the entire row of the table.
* Help page
* After the table is created, the input bars with balance, apr, etc are hidden. And when that shows, the add bar is hidden.
* Add more details for the pie chart.
* Functionalize the implementation of the pie chart.
* HTML & CSS
* Add option for the type of rate (APR now), ex: monthly rate, yearly rate, etc.
* Have implementation also account for positive interest such as money in a savings account, etc. (Again, no experience. Will have to research).
