		<p>This can be used for calculating payments for a credit card or even for something like a mortage. Note: it doesn't work for Internet Explorer (at least when I tried it). I apologize for this. I hope to fix this eventually.</p>

		<p>To calculate the minimal payment to pay in X amount of months, leave the payment option empty. To calculate the min. months it will take, leave months empty while filling in pament. Fill in both of them to calculate the payment info for that period of time.</p>

		<p>Right click on an input to clear it.</p>

		<p>After you make the chart / table, there is an option to modify the payments by adding in an amount and then selecting the checkboxes in the &quot;check&quot; column of the table and the submitting (the second submit button). You can subtract payments by adding in a negative number.</p>

		<p>Local storage to stop input data and the table info, so this may not work for older browsers. Also, there's canvas that makes the pie chart but isn't significant.</p>
